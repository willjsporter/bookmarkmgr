CRUD is the four key operations when dealing with databases or more generally, when dealing with any persistent storage.

In terms of databases:

C stands for create: this is the actions involved in creating new databases or inputting new information into a DB.

R stands for read: this is viewing databases

U stands for update: is for changing info about databases or their content

D stands for delete: this is deleting databases or the info inside them.

SQL is an acronym for Structured Query Language. It is used to interact with databases.

For creating, SQL may use an action such as CREATE - this can be used on databases, columns, rows and tables
For update, SQL may use an action such as UPDATE
R uses SELECT
D uses DELETE or TRUNCATE, or DROP to destroy a whole thing.
